# WoW-Export-Map-to-Blender

### This Repo is WIP!
You should be able to use it already but there are still a few features missing.

---

This is a hobby project to export World of Warcraft Map chunks to Blender.

---

My work was influenced by the kind [Lornek](https://www.reddit.com/user/lornek "Lornek") and his absolutely stunning [job](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/a12g4p/not_sure_why_but_i_just_spent_like_3_days_coding/).

This is a python script that needs to be executed within Blender. The Blender file needs to be in the same folder as the exported OBJs
and textures using [WoW Model Exporter](https://marlam.in/obj/)


Still to do:
+ alpha textures
+ remove double vertecies
+ add skybox
+ group and center all the objects
+ add doodats to the models
+ refactor


Please note that this is my first time using Python and doing Blender Scripting.
